Glad you made it!  The purpose of this organization is to connect artists and developers so creativity can flourish, and amazing project can be made.  With the internet, we are more connected than ever before, and open source offers a truly unique kind of collaboration.

>"One of the fundamental concepts of open source is the acknowledgement that creative inspiration comes from social interaction, peer-to-peer methods of collaboration, collegial sharing, and collective research. Vladimir Hafstein describes open source systems as based on the creative processes of social dynamics: “Creativity as a social process is the common denominator of these concepts and approaches. From each of these perspectives, the act of creation is a social act… works of literature are just as much a product of society or of discourse as they are of an individual author or, for that matter, reader.”   - Open Source Studio, Ruth Catlow & Marc Garrett, DIWO: Do it With Others – No Ecology Without Social Ecology 

>"A salon is a gathering of people under the roof of an inspiring host, held partly to amuse one another and partly to refine the taste and increase the knowledge of the participants through conversation." - Wikipedia.
